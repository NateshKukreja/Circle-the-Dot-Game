# Circle-the-Dot-Game

Implementation of the iPhone and Andriod Game. Created in Java using a GUI

Update 1 (March 22nd/2016): I am trying to implement a Redo and Undo button for the game. I am using Stacks and Queues to implement this idea. 

Update 2 (March 24th/2016): The undo and redo buttons work for the yellow button. I am still trying to figure it out for the blue button

Update 3 (March 26th/2016): Added exceptions to the Stack method and updated the gameController method. Blue undo works.
